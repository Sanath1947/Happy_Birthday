      - Click "Next"
   6. Configure sign-up experience:
      - Select required attributes (email is recommended)
      - Click "Next"
   7. Configure message delivery:
      - Choose "Send email with Cognito"
      - Click "Next"
   8. Integrate your app:
      - Enter a name for your user pool (e.g., "HappyBirthdayUserPool")
      - Under "Initial app client":
        - Enter a name (e.g., "HappyBirthdayWebClient")
        - Select "Public client"
        - Don't generate a client secret
      - Click "Next"
   9. Review and create
   10. After creation, note down:
       - User Pool ID (looks like: `ap-south-1_xxxxxxxx`)
       - App client ID (looks like: `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
   
   **Option B: Using CloudFormation Template**
   
   1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
   2. Navigate to CloudFormation service
   3. Click "Create stack" ‚Üí "With new resources (standard)"
   4. Upload the `cognito-config.yaml` template from this repository
   5. Click "Next"
   6. Enter a stack name (e.g., "happy-birthday-cognito")
   7. Click "Next" through the remaining options
   8. Click "Create stack"
   9. Once deployment is complete, go to "Outputs" tab
   10. Note down the User Pool ID and Client ID values

   #### 2. Setting Up API Gateway and Lambda Functions
   
   **Option A: Using the AWS Management Console**
   
   1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
   2. Navigate to API Gateway service
   3. Click "Create API"
   4. Choose "REST API" and click "Build"
   5. Enter API name (e.g., "HappyBirthdayAPI")
   6. Create resources and methods as needed
   7. Deploy the API to a stage (e.g., "prod")
   8. Note the Invoke URL (e.g., `https://xxxxx.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/prod/`)
   
   **Option B: Using AWS Amplify**
   
   1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
   2. Navigate to AWS Amplify service
   3. Click "New app" ‚Üí "Host web app"
   4. Connect your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/Sanath1947/Happy_Birthday.git`
   5. Select the main branch
   6. Use the provided `amplify.yml` configuration
   7. Deploy through the Amplify Console
   8. Note the Amplify app URL (e.g., `https://main.d123xyz.amplifyapp.com`)
   9. The API URL will be available in the Amplify Console under "Backend environments"

   #### 3. Setting Up S3 for Media Storage
   
   1. Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/)
   2. Navigate to S3 service
   3. Click "Create bucket"

   5. Select your region
   6. Configure bucket settings:
      - Block all public access (recommended for production)
      - Enable versioning if needed
   7. Click "Create bucket"
   8. Configure CORS for the bucket:
      - Select your bucket
      - Go to "Permissions" tab
      - Scroll down to "Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)"
      - Click "Edit" and add the following configuration:

          {
            "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
            "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
            "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
            "ExposeHeaders": []
          }
        ]
        ```

4. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the application:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

   **Troubleshooting local development:**
   - **CORS issues**: Ensure your API Gateway has CORS enabled
   - **Authentication failures**: Verify Cognito credentials are correct
   - **Environment variables not loading**: Restart the development server
   - **S3 access denied**: Check bucket permissions and CORS configuration

### Deployed Application Access

1. **Deploy the application using AWS Amplify:**
   - Go to [AWS Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home)
   - Click "New app" ‚Üí "Host web app"

   - Use the provided `amplify.yml` configuration
   - Deploy through the Amplify Console
   - Note the Amplify app URL (e.g., `https://main.d123xyz.amplifyapp.com`)

2. **Access the live application:**
   - Open your browser and navigate to the Amplify app URL
   - Sign in with your Cognito credentials

   **Troubleshooting deployment:**
   - **Amplify build failures**: Check build logs in Amplify Console
   - **Authentication issues**: Verify Cognito User Pool configuration
   - **API Gateway issues**: Check Lambda function permissions and API Gateway settings
   - **S3 access issues**: Verify bucket permissions and CORS configuration
